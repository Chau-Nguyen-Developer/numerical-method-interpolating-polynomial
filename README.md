# Numerical-method-interpolating-polynomial
I wrote a program (work in progress) that creates a divdied difference table from the given data in a text file and uses that to create the interpolating polynomial. I aim to print the polynomial in both the Newton's form and Lagrange's form.


# Progress so far
* Able to print out interpolating polynomial with four nodes. Will continue to generalize my functions so that my program can work with any data (at most 50 node points).
* Currently, the program only works with the sample data (input.txt). 

# Future milestones

* [ ] Print out simplified polynomial form from interpolating polynomial form.
* [ ] Make the program more generalized.
* [ ] Edit the format of divided difference table.
* [ ] Optimize program. Create private functions to reuse the code more.
